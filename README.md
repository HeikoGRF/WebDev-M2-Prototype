# React App

This is a basic React application.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build for Production

```bash
npm build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite
- `npm eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)
